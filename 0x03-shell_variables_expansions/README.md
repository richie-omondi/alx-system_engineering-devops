This folder contains Bash scripts that implement the following:

- 0-alias - Creates an alias.
- 1-hello_you - Create a script that prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user.
- 2-path - Adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
- 3-paths - Counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.
